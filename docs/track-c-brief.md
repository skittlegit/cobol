# Track C — Execution Brief (T0.3, T0.4, T0.6, T3.1–T3.6)

Agent, RAG & Evaluation track. Near-term milestones: close the M0 items this track owns, then
**M3 — Agent Grounded** (agent navigates real tools, emits findings with a verifiable trace:
clause → slice → behavior → citation). Phase 4+ (T4.x metrics runs, baselines, migration,
paper) is out of scope for this brief. Tasks marked **[chat]** happen in the Track C chat;
**[code]** via Claude Code in this repo. Read `CLAUDE.md` first.

## Dependency correction (supersedes earlier Track C assessment)
T0.4 is **not fully blocked**. `CONTRACT.md` has two halves: the **tool I/O contract is already
fixed** — copy it verbatim from `docs/track-a-phase1-brief.md` §T1.6 (Track A implements those
signatures; do not redesign them). Only the **metrics-targets half** waits on Track B's T0.2
taxonomy lock. Materialize the tool half now.

## Not blocked on Track A: the stub strategy
All Phase-3 code develops against the `tools.py` *interface*, not Track A's implementation.
Build `src/cobol_archaeologist/agent/stub_tools.py`: a `StubToolLayer` returning canned,
schema-valid responses from fixtures (`tests/fixtures/stub_tools/`). The agent loop takes the
tool layer as a constructor argument; swapping stub→real at the Week-7 seam test must be a
one-line change.

## T0.3 — Freeze DriftInstance schema **[code]** — `src/cobol_archaeologist/schemas.py`
Pydantic v2 models: `RegulationClause{doc, clause_id, version, effective_date, text,
current_value{kind, value}}`, `CodeLocus{programs, paragraphs, line_span, slice_vars,
is_interprocedural}`, `Labels{program_level, paragraph_level, line_level}`,
`Provenance{source: "synthetic"|"real_curated", base_program, mutation}`, and
`DriftInstance` composing them with `drift_type: Literal["D1_stale_threshold", …, "D7_conformant"]`
and `gold_rationale`. `effective_date` and `version` are **required, not optional** — the
temporal axis is the project's novelty and must be structurally unavoidable.
**Done when:** round-trip test (model → JSON → model) passes on a fixture instance; the D-class
literals await Track B's T0.2 lock before the freeze is declared (the code can land now).

## T0.4 — CONTRACT.md **[chat → repo doc]** — `docs/CONTRACT.md`
Two sections: (1) **Tool I/O** — the §T1.6 table from the Track A brief, verbatim, plus the
structured-return rule (summaries + pointers, ≤60-line code caps). (2) **Metrics + targets** —
embed the definitions below and set the bar: suggested **T1 F1 ≥ 0.70 overall**, and the
headline: **agent beats dense-RAG by a clear, CI-backed margin on interprocedural instances**.
**Done when:** signed off in all three track chats (post it; A and B confirm).

Metric definitions (source of truth once this doc lands):
- **T1 Detection** P/R/F1 on a class-balanced set · **T2 Localization** Accuracy@k +
  line-overlap at program/paragraph/line · **T3 Classification** Macro-F1 over D1–D7 ·
- **T4 Faithfulness** — cited clause correct AND cited code fact matches `gold_rationale`;
  **reported per verification tier** (see T3.4) · **T5 Migration** (optional) behavioral pass
  rate · **T6 Versioned judgment** — same code, two clause versions, different correct answers;
  paired accuracy. All metrics stratified by `is_interprocedural` and `drift_type`; headline
  comparisons carry bootstrap CIs + a paired significance test.

## T0.6 — Lit review + novelty sentence **[chat]**
Verify the open cell (COBOL × financial regulation × temporal drift) against, minimum:
GDPR-Bench-Android, CompliBench, XMainframe/MainframeBench, COBOL-Coder, CardDemo MCP work,
plus a fresh search for anything newer (reg-compliance benchmarks, legacy-code agents, temporal
code reasoning). Deliverable: `docs/T0.6-related-work.md` — table (work | what it does | why it
doesn't cover our cell) + **one-sentence novelty claim**. Use live web search; do not rely on
memory for prior-art claims. **Done when:** claim drafted and it survives the table.

---

## T3.1 — Structure-aware chunking **[code]** — `rag/chunker.py` (+ `rag/pdf_loader.py`)
Chunk regulation documents on their hierarchy (chapter → section → clause), each chunk carrying
`heading_path`, `clause_id`, `version`, `effective_date` as metadata. Input: Track B's
`data/regulations/clauses.jsonl` + source PDFs. **Done when:** chunks align to clause
boundaries on the anchor doc (fixture test with 10 hand-checked boundaries).

## T3.2 — Hybrid retrieval + reranker **[code]** — `rag/index.py`, `rag/embed.py`
Dense embeddings + BM25 with reciprocal-rank fusion; cross-encoder reranker on top-20 → top-5.
Offline-capable embedder (deployment target is air-gapped banks — no cloud-only components in
the retrieval path). **Done when:** top-k relevance beats dense-only on a ≥20-query eval set
(queries written while doing T2.1 review; commit as `tests/fixtures/retrieval_queries.jsonl`).

## T3.3 — HyDE **[code]** — `rag/`, `model/prompt.py`
Generate a short NL description of the code slice ("what rule does this implement?"), retrieve
on that instead of raw variable names. **Done when:** measurable retrieval gain vs raw-query on
the same eval set.

## T3.4 — Entailment verification + tiers **[code]** — `model/verify.py`
`verify(finding) -> Verification{tier, evidence, passed}` with tiers: **1** behaviorally
executed via `run_cobol` · **2** statically confirmed (AST/dataflow fact matches claim) ·
**3** entailment-only (NLI: clause ⊨ claim). Requirements: the NLI verifier is a **different
model family** than the system under test; its own accuracy is **human-validated on ≥50
labeled pairs** and reported; every finding records its tier (CICS code will mostly cap at
Tier 2 — that's expected and must be visible, not hidden). **Done when:** rejects a planted
unsupported citation; tier recorded per finding; verifier accuracy measured.

## T3.5 — ReAct agent loop **[code]** — `agent/loop.py`
think → tool call → observe, against the tool-layer interface (stub first, real at the seam
test). Budgeted (max tool calls per finding, logged trajectory), structured scratchpad,
**abstention** ("insufficient evidence") as a first-class terminal state. **Done when:** on
stub fixtures, answers "where is the late-fee rule and what clause does it implement?" with
correct citations and a clean trajectory log.

## T3.6 — Drift-detection policy **[code]** — `model/prompt.py`, `agent/`
Given a clause record, hunt the codebase and classify per D1–D7, emitting a
`DriftInstance`-shaped finding + confidence + verification tier, or abstain. **Done when:** a
finding validates against `schemas.DriftInstance` and passes T3.4 verification on a stub case.

## Standing rules
1. The tool contract is Track A's to implement, this track's to consume — mismatches are a
   **CONTRACT CHANGE — affects Tracks A/B/C**, never a local workaround.
2. Any judge/verifier model must be a different family than the system under test; record
   family + version in every run log.
3. Retrieval and verification components must run offline (local embedder, local NLI) — this
   is a deployment requirement (T7.2), cheaper to honor now than retrofit.
4. Log every agent trajectory (tool calls, tokens, outcome) from day one — T4.3 trajectory
   eval consumes them.
